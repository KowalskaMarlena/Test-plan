# Test plan for adding a product to the cart based on the API

## Test Objective:

- Verify the correctness of the functionality for adding a product to the cart from the perspective of the request and response.
- Ensure that the request and response align with expectations and meet the requirements.
- Check that the interaction between the request and response is functioning correctly.

## Test Environment:

- Operating System: Windows 10
- Web browser: Google Chrome
- API testing tools or tools for testing HTTP requests and responses
- Test data: available test products

## Test Scenarios:

### A. Adding a product to the cart:

Preconditions:The cart is empty. The page or API interface for adding a product to the cart is accessible.

- Step 1: Perform an HTTP request to add a product to the cart.
- Step 2: Verify the correctness of the HTTP request and response.
- Step 3: Validate if the product is successfully added to the cart.
- Step 4: Check if the displayed product information in the cart matches the expectations.

Expected result: The response will return a status code of 200.

## Test Procedures:

- Perform an HTTP request to add a product to the cart.
- Check if the request contains the correct data, such as the product identifier, quantity, etc.
- Verify the HTTP response, including the response code, response content, and other relevant fields.
- Validate if the product is successfully added to the cart.
- Check if the displayed product information in the cart matches the expectations.

## Success Criteria:

- The request to add a product to the cart returns a valid HTTP response.
- The product is successfully added to the cart.
- The displayed product information in the cart aligns with expectations.

## Risks and Considerations:

- Risk: Improper communication between the request and response, leading to errors in the process of adding a product to the cart.
- Consideration: Ensure that tests cover various scenarios, such as adding different types of products, adding a product that is already in the cart, etc.

## Test Schedule:

- Test environment and test data preparation - 1 day.
- Conducting tests for adding a product to the cart from the request and response perspective - 3 days.
- Analyzing results, reporting defects - 1 day.
